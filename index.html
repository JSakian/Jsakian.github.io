      <p> With San Antonio being his life long home, there is nowhere Jonathan would rather pour his heart and energy into building; he sees the best use of his time finding communities to build. Having a background in psychology, non-profits, politics, small business development, and software development enables him to bridge gaps and connect community leaders in ninja like ways.  Currently, his main focus is supporting civic tech and San Antonio's tech & geek community while it grows.
